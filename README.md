# Alien Workshop App

**Official Clients for Alien Workshop** — built to make **Artificial Intelligence & Operations** feel fast, practical, and real.

This repository is the home for the **public, user-facing clients** that connect people to Alien Workshop:

- **macOS** client
- **iOS** client
- **Android** client

It’s designed to be a clean entry point for builders who want to contribute to something ambitious without needing to learn the entire universe on day one.

## Why this exists

Modern work is fragmented:

- Knowledge lives across docs, tickets, chats, folders, and tabs.
- “Search” returns links, not answers.
- Creation is fast, but **production** is slow: revisions, structuring, formatting, reuse.
- Operations don’t scale when workflows remain manual.

Alien Workshop is being built around a simple thesis:

> **Language becomes an interface for work.**  
> You should be able to generate, edit, organize, retrieve, and operationalize information — then ship outcomes.

These clients are the front doors into that world: lightweight, focused, and built to be dependable.

## What these clients aim to deliver

**A faster path from intent → execution**  
Capture context quickly, ask better questions, and move from conversation to structured outputs.

**Retrieval that compounds**  
The more you use it, the more valuable it becomes — because information turns into reusable context.

**Workflows that feel like infrastructure**  
Not tools you try. Systems you rely on: consistent, repeatable, and built for real work.

**Community-built surfaces**  
Clients are where people feel the product. This repo is where the community helps sharpen that feeling.
